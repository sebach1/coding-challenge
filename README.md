# Coding challenge

The coding challenge has been done in two different approaches:

- [Django - Monolithic](https://github.com/sebach1/coding-challenge/tree/master/django)
- [Golang & Vue - Microservices](https://github.com/sebach1/coding-challenge/tree/master/microservices)

The setup and a brief description of how they work are inside their READMEs.
